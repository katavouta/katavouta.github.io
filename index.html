<p>I am an <strong>early career scientist</strong> based at the National Oceanography Center &amp; the University of Liverpool, UK.My research interest and experience lie in combining numerical models, observations and theory to study <strong>ocean processes and their role within the Earth system</strong> on different spatial scales, regional to global, and time scales, days to millennia.<p>


<p>I am interested in understanding the control of <strong>fundamental processes</strong> like ocean circulation, stratification and carbonate chemistry on the climate response to carbon emissions, as well as using this understanding to improve the projection of trends in physical and biogeochemical <strong>ocean properties crucial for the functioning of marine ecosystems</strong> especially in terms of regional scales and extreme events.<p>

<p>My <strong>diverse range of expertise</strong> includes the development and application of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conceptual and realistic numerical models for the shelf seas, the global ocean and the climate system.</li>
  <li>Statistical methods for analysing and reconstructing observations of the Earth system and their assimilation into numerical models.</li>
  <li>Conceptual frameworks to address processes/phenomena in the ocean and climate system.</li>
</ul>
