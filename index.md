I am an early career scientist based at the National Oceanography Centre & the University of Liverpool, UK. 
My research interests and experience lie in combining numerical models, observations and theory to **study ocean processes and their role within the Earth system** on different spatial scales, regional to global, and time scales, days to millennia.  


I am interested in understanding the control of **fundamental processes** like ocean circulation, stratification and carbonate chemistry on the climate response to carbon emissions, as well as using this understanding to improve the projection of trends in physical and biogeochemical **ocean properties crucial for the functioning of marine ecosystems** especially in terms of regional scales and extreme events.

# Expertise
My **diverse range of expertise** includes the development and application of:
* Conceptual and realistic numerical models for the shelf seas, the global ocean and the climate system. 
* Statistical methods for analysing and reconstructing observations of the Earth system and their assimilation into numerical models. 
* Conceptual frameworks to address processes/phenomena in the ocean and climate system.
