- **Shelf seas dynamics** and effect of tides on the water mass transformation, flow patterns and freshwater pathways.

- Control of ocean circulation, stratification and carbonate chemistry on the **climate response to carbon emissions** and warming trajectory.

- **Carbon cycle and climate feedback mechanisms** opearting in the climate system; e.g., Ocean acidification due to ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon further amplifying warming through a reduction in the the ocean ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

- **Climate change impact in shelf seas**: emergence of environmental stressors for marine ecosystems such as though climate-change induced trends and extreme events in temperature, pH, oxygen and nutrients availability   

- Shelf seas, opean ocean and climate **modelling**.

- **Statistical methods** for analysing and reconstructing observations of the Earth system and their assimilation into numerical models.
