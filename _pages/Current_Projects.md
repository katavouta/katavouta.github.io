# Indonesian Seas and Indonesian Throughflow: control mechanisms and impact of climate change

In my capacity at the National Oceanography Centre I am working on understanding the **mechanisms** that control the **circulation and hydrography** in the Indonesian Seas and how they respond to **climate change**. Particularly, I focus on: **(i)** the effect of tides in the regional water mass transformation, flow patterns and freshwater pathways, and in the Indonesian throughflow from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean; **(ii)** the response of these processes to climate change; and **(iii)** the effect of these evolving processes under climate change on the biogeochemical cycles in the Indonesian Seas.

For this project, in collaboration with the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, I have set-up a **regional model for the South East Asia (SEAsia)** based on the coupled NEMO/ERSEM hydrodynamic/ecosystem framework. Using this model I conduct several experiments, including sensitivity to tidal forcing, downscaling of climate projections in the Indonesian Seas based on the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, and realistic high resolution (~3 Km) simulations. This project is part of <a href="https://projects.noc.ac.uk/accord/">Addressing Challenges of Coastal Communities through Ocean Research for Developing Economies (ACCORD)</a>

# Control of climate response to carbon emissions by ocean heat uptake, ocean carbon uptake and climate feedbacks

In my capacity at the University of Liverpool I investigate how different processes and feedback mechanisms, like changes in **ocean circulation, ocean biology, carbonate chemistry and clouds**, control the **regional response** to carbon emissions on different Ocean basins. My focus is on: **(i)** the regional asymmetries in ocean heat and carbon anomalies driven by the effect of changes in the ocean circulation; **(ii)** the relative contribution of the diffent  basins to the carbon cycle feedbacks and the different mechanisms that dominate these feedbacks in the different basins; and **(iii)** the climate feedbacks and specifically the connection between changes in clouds and enhancement/weakening in ocean heat anomalies.

To investigate this ocean basin-wide response to carbon emissions I use **conceptual climate models**, sensitivity experiments with **realistic climate models** and future projections from the **latest generation Earth system models** (i.e, CMIP6). This project is funded by the standard NERC grant "Asymmetries in ocean heat and carbon uptake, and effects on marine hazards" led by Prof. Ric Williams, to which I am a Researcher Co-Investigator.

# Ocean carbon uptake and carbon cycle feedbacks in the Southern Ocean
I also investigate the ocean <b>carbon uptake</b> relationship with water mass transformation in the Southern Ocean, and the effect of the Southern Ocean on the global <b>carbon cycle feedbacks</b>. For this project I work in close collaboration with the "Southern Ocean carbon indices and metrics" (SARDINE) programme, which is part of a large scale effort to understand the role of the Southern Ocean in the Earth System <a href="https://roses.ac.uk/">(ROSES)</a>

<!--
e.g., ocean acidification due to ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon further amplifying warming through a reduction in the the ocean ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
- Climate feedbacks: e.g., changes in the amount of cloud due to warming can further amplify or slow down this warming.
