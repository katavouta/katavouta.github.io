Contribution to Global Heat and Carbon Uptake, <em>Nature Climate Change</em>,
14, 823â€“831, <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02066-3>.
<b><ins>Message</ins>:</b> The large asymmetry in the Southern Ocean in heat
uptake versus ocean carbon uptake over the historical period in
state-of-the-art climate models is attributed to suppressed heat uptake
by northern oceans from enhanced aerosol forcing.
<b><ins>Contribution</ins>:</b> I led the carbon analysis and contributed to
the interpretation of the results and writing. <b><ins>Highlights</ins>:</b>
The past is not a reliable indicator of the future, where greenhouse
gases increasingly dominate radiative forcing, with the northern oceans
becoming increasingly as important as the Southern Ocean for heat
uptake.</li>

[10.5194/bg-18-3189-2021](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3189-2021).
<b><ins>Message</ins>:</b> Over the next century, the Atlantic Ocean will store
a disproportionally large amount of anthropogenic carbon relative to its
size due to a strong local physical ventilation and an influx of carbon
transported from the Southern Ocean. However, the Atlantic Ocean will
experience the largest reduction in carbon uptake due to a feedback from
a weakening of the meridional overturning. <b><ins>Contribution</ins>:</b> I
conceived and wrote the study, and conducted the analysis &
interpretation. <b><ins>Highlights</ins></b>: Extension of my internatio-nally
recognised work on carbon feedbacks; led to my invited seminar at
Princeton University.

34(10), 3907-3925, <https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0519.1>.
<b><ins>Message</ins></b>: Projected changes in circulation drive a
redistribution of the pre-existing heat and carbon in the ocean, which
leads to regional asymmetries between climate-change induced heat and
carbon anomalies in the ocean. <b><ins>Contribution</ins>:</b> I led the
climate model analysis and the experiments with the idealised model, and
contributed to conceiving the concept, interpretation of results and
writing of the manuscript.

<b><ins>Message</ins>:</b> The spread in the climate response to emissions
amongst the CMIP6 models is, to first order, due to their large

[10.5194/bg-17-4173-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4173-2020).
<b><ins>Message</ins>:</b> The carbon feedbacks are more uncertain over land
than over the ocean in Earth System Models, reflecting the dominant
effect of biological processes over land. In contrast, over the ocean
these feedbacks are primarily controlled by carbonate chemistry and
physical ventilation, which is more consistently represented in models.

analysis, interpretation, writing). <b><ins>Highlights</ins></b>: Activity
related to the <em>WCRP Grand Challenge on Carbon Feedbacks</em>; used and
