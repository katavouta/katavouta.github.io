I was borned and grew up in Greece. After completing my Bachelor's degree in physics in Greece, I moved to Canada for my grad studies (MSc and PhD) where I lived for almost 8 years. Since 2016 I have lived and worked in the UK.

My research focuses on the effect of shelf processes on the dynamics of the Indonesian Seas and the Indonesian throughflow, and their response to climate change. I am currently conducint a part-time <b>secondment at the University of Liverpool</b>, where I investigate ocean carbon and air-sea/cloud feedbacks operating in the climate system.</p>

As a **graduate student** I focused on the practical application of numerical models, as well as their use in understanding the dynamics of high-latitude shelf seas. During my **MSc**, I developed an efficient scheme for the assimilation of sea ice observations into coupled sea ice/ocean models. During my **PhD**, I developed a high-resolution regional model for the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf (GoMSS), and an ocean downscaling method that draws upon the non-linear coupling between different length scales. Using this model I investigated the interaction between seasonal and tidal variability in the region.

My **postdoctoral position** at the University of Liverpool marked a transition from physical oceanography to climate science. During this post, I reconciled theory and combined it with conceptual and realistic Earth system models to investigate the effect of ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry on the climate response to carbon emissions.
