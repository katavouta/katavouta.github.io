I was borned and grew up in Greece. After completing my Bachelor's degree in physics in Greece, I moved to Canada for my grad studies (MSc and PhD) where I lived for almost 8 years. Since 2016 I have lived and worked in the UK.

<p><a href="/assets/figures/CUR_SEAsia_large.png"><img src="/assets/figures/CUR_SEAsia_large.png" style="float:right;width:50%"></a>Since 2019, I work as a <b>scientist at the National Oceanography Centre</b> focusing on the response of shelf seas to climate change, in terms of emerging climate-induced heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients signals, and the dynamic drivers of regional variability in this response. I am particularly interested in the effect of shelf processes on the dynamics of the Indonesian Seas and the Indonesian throughflow. I am also currently conducing a part-time <b>secondment at the University of Liverpool</b>, where I investigate the carbon and air-sea/cloud feedbacks operating in the climate system.</p>

As a **graduate student** I focused on the practical application of numerical models, as well as their use in understanding the dynamics of high-latitude shelf seas. During my **MSc**, I developed an efficient scheme for the assimilation of sea ice observations into coupled sea ice/ocean models. During my **PhD**, I developed a high-resolution regional model for the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf (GoMSS), and an ocean downscaling method that draws upon the non-linear coupling between different length scales. Using this model I investigated the interaction between seasonal and tidal variability in the region.

My **postdoctoral position** at the University of Liverpool marked a transition from physical oceanography to climate science. During this post, I reconciled theory and combined it with conceptual and realistic Earth system models to investigate the effect of ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry on the climate response to carbon emissions.
