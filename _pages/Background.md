I was borned and grew up in Greece. After completing my Bachelor's degree in physics in Greece, I moved to Canada for my grad studies (MSc and PhD) where I lived for almost 8 years. Since 2016 I have lived and worked in the UK.

<p><img align="left" width="40%" src="/assets/figures/CUR_SEAsia_large.png" />Since 2019, I work as a <b> research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre</b> focusing on the response of shelf seas to climate change and the dynamic drivers of regional variability in this response. I also investigate the role of the global-scale ocean on the Earth's system reposnse to climate change, with particular interest in ocean heat and carbon uptake and its redistribution by the changing circulation, and carbon-cycle and climate feedbacks </p>

As a **graduate student** I focused on the practical application of numerical models, as well as their use in understanding the dynamics of high-latitude shelf seas. During my **MSc**, I developed an efficient scheme for the assimilation of sea ice observations into coupled sea ice/ocean models. During my **PhD**, I developed a high-resolution regional model for the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf (GoMSS), and an ocean downscaling method that draws upon the non-linear coupling between different length scales. Using this model I investigated the interaction between seasonal and tidal variability in the region.

During this post, I reconciled theory and combined it with conceptual and realistic Earth system models to investigate the effect of ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry on the climate response to carbon emissions.
