**Shelf seas dynamics**
- Effect of regional proccesses (air-sea fluxes, tides, river outflow) on water mass transformation and flow patterns. 
- Imprint of large scale ocean and climate patterns on shelf seas.

---

**Role of the ocean to the climate response to carbon emissions**
- Effect of different mechanisms: ocean statification, circulation and carbonate chemistry. 
- Variability and uncertainty amongst Earth system models.

--- 

**Feedback mechanisms operating in the climate system and their effect in regulating climate change**
- Carbon cycle feedbacks, such as from changes in carbonate chemistry (i.e., acidification) and the ocean circulation.
- Climate feedbacks, such as from changes in air-sea exchange and clouds.   

---

**Climate change impact in shelf seas**
- Effect of fine-scale shelf processes vs large-scale open ocean patterns in different shelf seas.  
- Emergence of environmental stressors for marine ecosystems: warming, acidification, hypoxia, nutrients availability. 

---

**Numerical modelling: shelf seas, opean ocean and climate**
- Conceptual and idealised models.
- Realistic numerical models.
- Regional downscaling

<!--
e.g., ocean acidification due to ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon further amplifying warming through a reduction in the the ocean ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
- Climate feedbacks: e.g., changes in the amount of cloud due to warming can further amplify or slow down this warming.
