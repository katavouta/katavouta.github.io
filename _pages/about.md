I am an early career scientists based at the National Oceanography Center & the University of Liverpool, UK.

I am interested in understanding the control of **fundamental processes** like ocea circulation, stratification and carbonate chemistry on the climate response to carbon emissions, as well as using this understanding to improve the projection of trends in physical and biogeochemical **ocean properties crucial for the functioning of marine ecosystems** especially in terms of regional scales and extreme events.

My **diverse range of expertise** includes the development and application of:
* Conceptual and realistic numerical models for the shelf seas, the global ocean and the climate system. 
* Statistical methods for analysing and reconstructing observations of the Earth system and their assimilation into numerical models 
* Conceptual frameworks to address unexplained phenomena in the ocean and climate system.
