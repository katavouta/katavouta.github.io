I was born and grew up in Greece and lived in Canada for almost 8 years during my grad studies (MSc and PhD). Since 2016 I live and work in the UK.

<p><a href="/assets/figures/CUR_SEAsia_large.png"><img src="/assets/figures/CUR_SEAsia_large.png" style="float:right;width:50%"></a>I am currently a <b>scientist at the National Oceanography Centre</b>. My research focuses on the effect of shelf processes on the dynamics of the Indonesian Seas and the Indonesian throughflow, and their response to climate change. I also hold a <b>research associate position at the University of Liverpool</b>, where I investigate the role of the ocean on the climate response to emissions and on the carbon cycle and climate feedbacks operating in the climate system.</p>

As a **graduate student** I focused on the practical application of numerical models, as well as their use in understanding the dynamics of high-latitude shelf seas. During my **MSc**, I developed an efficient scheme for the assimilation of sea ice observations into coupled sea ice/ocean models.

During my **PhD** I developed a high-resolution regional model of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf (GoMSS), and an ocean downscaling method drawing upon the non-linear coupling between different length scales. Using this model I investigated the interaction between seasonal and tidal variability in the region.

My **postdoctoral position** at the University of Liverpool marked a transition from physical oceanography to climate science. During this post, I reconciled theory and combined it with conceptual and realistic Earth system models to investigate the effect of carbonate chemistry and ocean ventilation on the climate response to carbon emissions and the carbon cycle and climate feedbacks.
