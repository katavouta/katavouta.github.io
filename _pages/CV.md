**Summer Schools & Workshops** (selected)
Ferbuary 2022 (upcoming): Co-organising the first “Future Coastal Ocean Climates” (FLAME) international workshop.

June 2021: Participation to the CMIP6 Data Hackathon - part of the Met Office Climate Data Challenge Hackathon series during 2021. Led to a collaboration for addressing the effects of climate change on Biological Carbon Pump (paper 17 in <a href="/Publications/">my list of Pulications</a>).

August 2018: Swiss Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR) Summer School. Participation in this summer school is highly competitive and is limited to a maximum of 70 young researchers from all fields of climate research.

---

**Diverse proven expertise in** (demonstrated by <a href="/Publications/">my pulications</a>): ocean and climate sciences, shelf seas dynamics, numerical modelling for ocean/climate, downscaling methods for regional models, statistical methods for analysis and reconstruction of Earth system observations.
